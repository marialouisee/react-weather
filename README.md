<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project has been created to set into action what I have learned since starting react 1.5 month ago. The aim was to use and an API, I went with the Openweathermap API, and React Hooks (especially useContext and useReducer).

The App will let you choose between your current location and a city of your linking. Select the current weather or a forecast (3h from now and tomorrow). Gimmick: Play music matching the weather conditions.

I didn't particularly liked the Openweathermap icons and decided to work with the simple but charming react-weather-icons (react icons) -> [Clouds.js](https://github.com/marialouisee/react-weather/blob/main/src/components/Clouds.js) component


### Built With

* This application in created with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) *(v17.0.2)*
* Styling syntax was written in SCSS
